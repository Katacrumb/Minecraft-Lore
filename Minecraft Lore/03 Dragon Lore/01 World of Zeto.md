### The land of<font color =E2D444> Escrabra</font>
Escrabra is hell on earth with temperatures rising up to 100 degrees, and only being inhabited by various mobs. Little to now flora is able to grow here due to the intense heat and mountains of sand that cover this area. Very few villages have been able to exist because of the high temperatures, so the people who do live in Escrabra live a very nomadic life.

### The land of <font color=  5257E7>Platuas</font>

Large oceans that seem to have no end are inhabited by pirates and sea nomads. Coral reefs and underwater temples fill the empty spaces of the area. Its not uncommon to find massive glaciers for miles on end, due to the harsh conditions of the sea, the only inhabitants of this biome are guardians or the drowned.

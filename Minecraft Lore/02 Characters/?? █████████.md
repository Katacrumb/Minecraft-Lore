A force to be reckoned with, no information is found on ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. What is known is the traces of what seems to be imprints left in rocks left around last known areas that ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà was in. These remnants however have been found months even years apart so the validity of any of this information should up for questioning. People who have claimed to have seen ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà suggest they have a heavy gaze and an ominous aura that always follows them. They also seem to have a large hilt of what could be a sword strapped around their waist, the sheath of the sword looks very flat so there may or may not be a sword in there. (But why carry a hilt?) Some also say he is able to conjure up items from nothing and teleport like an enderman. But again all hear say till proven.

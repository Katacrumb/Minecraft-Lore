>Known only as Silver, all that is known is that shes running... from what no one knows.

Roaming the lands of [[01 World of Zeto|Zeto]], Silver has mastered the skill of deceiving folk to get better resources. This allowed her to rub shoulders with the elite. Or maybe she was already the elite?

Not much is known about Silver due to her elusive nature. She's been seen around the land talking to mayors and politicians claiming to be a princess from a lost land. Many believe her due to the amulet she carries on her crown, made with a rare Emerald=, this alone proves to many that she has no reason to lie. She's able to travel many places due to the funds she gets from the politicians she talks to.

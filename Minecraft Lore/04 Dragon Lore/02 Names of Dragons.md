##  Ad'rehal - The Demon from Hell 
 Considered a Pillar of the nether, the demon of the red lands, He has sole responsibility of the nether and understanding of how the realm below is held up. Ad'Rehal is unable to travel from the nether to the overworld but the  people of the land of [[01 World of Zeto#The land of  Escrabra |Escrabra]], found northwest (check obsidian tower), found a way to connect the nether to the overworld and decided to hone the power of forbidden magic, and release Ad'rehal to [[01 World of Zeto#The Land of Burnish|Burnish]] (The area that surround the tower) This started the 1,000 year war.

## Grah'tza 
Unknown to why she abides to the land of [[01 World of Zeto#The Land of Burnish|Burnish]] , the people tend to stay away from her fearsome gaze... given she has two heads. Most interactions between the mythical creature tend to be very short. The heads of the dragons seem to have different personalities with the rock armored head being more aggressive while the yellow horned head is more introverted but willing to scare off others who trespass.

## <font color= 00BFFF>Braya</font>

Braya is an unknown beast that used to lurk the depths of [[01 World of Zeto#The land of <font color= 5257E7>Platuas</font>|Platuas]] Given the lack of technology to be able to explore the deep sea, little is known about Braya. Researchers believe that Braya was the entity that could take on both Gre'Tza and Ad'Rehal. Braya could have been the reason the 1,000 year war ended, but no remains of the beast were found around the war site. Large silver sclaes were found however near the shore of the battle site, which may have meant that Braya was a sea based monster and this puts the theory that she ended the war up in the air. Shes rumoured to be able to control the seas at whim, whether it be large fins or an essence only She holds... there is no data to support either theory.

# <font color=BF2222>The Thousand Year War</font>
Little is known about the Thousand year war but what the impacts of the war are felt throughout the land. Many areas of [[01 World of Zeto|Burnish]] are riddled with dead plants and skeletons from the warriors that both Grah'tza & Ad'Rehal recruited to fight for them. All creatures alike surrounded and destroyed each other for unknown reasons. Researchers from all over have different opinions as to why the war started but not many know why the war ended.
